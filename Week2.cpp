/*
reasons for errors
poor specifications, what is it suppose to do?
incomplete program
unexpected arguments
unexpected input
code that dosent do what its suppose to do
*/

/*
types of errors
compile times
    syntax errors
    type errors
Link-time errors
Run-time errors
    detected by computer(crash)
    detected by libraries(exceptions)
    detected by user code
Logic errors
    detected by programmer or user(code runs, produces wrong output)

Collection of data
